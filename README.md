### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome on my GitHub profile!

My name is MichaÅ‚ and I'm a student of Applied Computer Science at WrocÅ‚aw University of Science and Technology :school:. I love doing sports (football :soccer:, cycling :bicyclist:, working out :runner:). Since I was a child, I was also interested in computer games :computer: and their creation. I started my adventure with programming in middle school. I began with C++ and later turned for C#, in order to create games on the Unity engine and applications in Visual Studio. Currently, I write the most in Java.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating board games and implementing simple AI to them.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: JavaFX, Java Spring, Python.
